# Manual Cluster
## Design
The following diagram outlines the design of the cluster.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7156097/13850591/9a553fde-ec28-11e5-8fa7-675f96743a10.png)
## Requirements

For complete deployment requirements and instructions, please see the [Deployment Page](../installation-guide/index.md).
The requirements for Clusters vary only in the RAM requirement. Clusters require at least 8GB RAM for smooth performance. The requirements below are specific for Cluster Installation VMs.


|	Number of VMs	|CPU Units	|	RAM	|Root Partion	|	Port Requirements	|
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
|	2		|	2 CPU ea.	|	8 GB	|	40 GB	|	4444 and 8989 (LDAP replication), 30865 (file system syncing)|

**Note:** For convenience, the VMs are identified as `host-1` and `host-2`

## Preparing VMs

* Install Gluu CE following the [Deployment Page](../installation-guide/index.md) in `host-1`

* <sub>*`(!)`Please note: you must do this step right after initial installation on the 2nd node, but before you'll run setup.py script there`(!)`*</sub> Copy `setup.properties.last` that will be generated in `/install/community-edition-setup/` right after `setup.py`'s completion on `host-1`, change IP address in it to the one of `host-2` and put it into the same directory of `host-2` while renaming the file to `setup.properties`, then run `setup.py` the usual way. As it won't be running in interactive mode this way, make sure you'll provide all optional components (like Shibboleth, Asimba etc) you need to be installed explicitly with keys (run `# ./setup.py -h` for full list of them) Please be sure to read [this part](./index.md#optional-actions-in-case-setuppropertieslast-method-of-installation-didnt-work-for-you) in case you failed to setup the 2nd node using `setup.properties.last` file from the 1st one for some reason, and resorted to installing it from scratch, that will call for additional steps.

## LDAP Replication

* Things to know

|	host-1			|	host-2		   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
|IP Address eg. 192.168.6.1	|Ip Address eg. 192.168.6.2|
|	LDAP admin pass		|	LDAP admin pass	   |
|ldapGeneralConfigInstall.py	|
|replicationSetup.py		|

* Run [ldapGeneralConfigInstall.py](./ldapGeneralConfigInstall.py) in `host-1`. This script will prepare the `host-1` LDAP server to accept various configurations such as `allow-pre-encoded-passwords` or applyting the host and port for LDAP Server.

* Run [replicationSetup.py](./replicationSetup.py) in `host-1` and it will give a similar output as below:

```
[ldap@]$ python replicationSetup.py 
Create a password for the replication admin: 
Enter number of OpenDJ servers: 2
Enter the hostname of server 1: 192.168.6.1
Enter the Directory Manager password for 192.168.6.1: xxxxx
Enter the hostname of server 2: 192.168.6.2

Replication has been successfully enabled.  Note that for replication to work you must initialize the contents of the base DNs that are being replicated (use dsreplication initialize to do so).

operation.

* Initialize directory server replication with this command `/opt/opendj/bin/dsreplication initialize` and it will give the following output:

<sub>*`(!)` OpenDJ may become picky about certificates used for SSL connections during replication in certain linux distros. Make sure you've added certificates of each OpenDJ instance to default java key storage of each node; another option is to use the same OpenDJ certificate/key pair for both nodes*</sub>   

## File System Replication

<sub>*`(!)` Be advised that backup feature is broken in some of earlier versions of csync2 you may get installed from your distribution's repo. In that case you will need either to disable it by commenting out `backup-*` clauses in tool's configuration file, or to build csync2 of version 2.0+ from sources and use key `-l` in your xinetd.d's config (like `server_args     = -i -l -N idp1.gluu.org`) on both nodes.*</sub>   
<sub>*`(!)` Be sure to verify all pathes (for executables, keys etc) in configuration files' examples before using them in your production instance, as they may differ for different linux distros.*</sub>

`csync2` is used for file system syncing between `host-1` and `host-2`. The following locations are synced in between the two VMs.

1. /opt/idp/conf
2. /opt/idp/metadata
3. /opt/idp/ssl
4. /opt/tomcat/conf
5. /etc/csync2/csync2.cfg

### Csync2 installation

Please follow steps provided in next articles to install csync2 on both nodes: [CentOS 6.x](./csync-installation.md#centos-6x), [CentOS 7.x](./csync-installation.md#centos-7x), [Ubuntu 14.x (from repo)](./csync-installation.md#ubuntu-14x-from-repo), [Ubuntu 14.x (compiling from sources)](./csync-installation.md#ubuntu-14x-compiling-from-sources).

### Csync2 configuration for host-1

1. Log into Gluu-Server container

2. Generate `csync2` private key by running `csync2 -k csync2.key` and put it into `/etc/csync2/csync2.key` file

3. Copy the private key to `host-2` and put it into the same file there

4. Generate certificate/key pair that will be used to establish SSL protection layer for incoming connections by running next commands on <code>host-1</code> (location of the files and their names are hardcoded into executable). Don't fill any fields, just hit `Enter` accepting default values:

```
openssl genrsa -out /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem 1024
openssl req -new -key /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem -out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 600 -in /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr -signkey /etc/csync 2_ssl_key.pem \
-out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.pem
```
In case you've compiled csync from sources you may opt to just run `# make cert` while in the sources' directory, it will do everything for you.

## Certificate Management

The certificates do not vary in the manual cluster configuration. The certificates should be updated manually 
in each host, when required. Move to `/etc/certs/` on the 1st node (inside the container). Copy all keys, certs and key storages conforming to these masks: `httpd.*`, `asimba.*`, `asimbaIDP.*` and `shibIDP.*` to the same directory on the 2nd node (overwriting files that exist there; you may opt to backup them first, just in case).

After that's done you still will need to update default system storage (`cacerts` file) at the 2nd node with these newly copied certificates.

## [Optional] Actions in case setup.properties.last method of installation didn't work for you

In this case jks keystores you'll be moving to the 2nd node will be protected by passwords hardcoded into different configuration files on the 1st node, which are different from the similar passwords hardcoded into the same files on the 2nd node.

Thus you MUST ensure that the 1st node will be the one that will initialize the 2nd node during first csync's run (i.e., that it will win any conflicts due to changes in files that csync may detect during its very first run), as otherwise different components won't be able to decrypt these keystores and will fail.

To achieve this you should run initial sync manualy after completing configuring it, but before you install cron jobs:

1. Comment out `auto younger;` string in `csync2.cfg` on both nodes to disable autoresolution of conflicts

2. Run `# csync2 -crvvv -N idp1.gluu.org` on the 1st node

3. Run `# csync2 -crvvv -N idp2.gluu.org` on the 2nd node

4. Previous commands did initial scan and filled metadata database. Now run `# csync2 -xrvvv -N idp1.gluu.org` on the 1st node. That will try to sync files with the 2nd node, and most likely will fail to replicate all files due to some conflicts.

5. You should be now in a state of conflict, as certain files in directories to be synced differ between nodes and tool can't decide which to prefer. Run this `# csync2 -frvvv -N idp1.gluu.org /` on the 1st node to mark its files that still in dirty state as the ones that will win any conflict next time.

6. Run `# csync2 -xrvvv -N idp1.gluu.org` on the 1st node to complete your initial sync. Now all your 2nd node's directories covered by csync should be identical to the 1st node's.

7. Uncomment `auto younger;` string and proceed to installing cron jobs
